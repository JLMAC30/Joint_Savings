### Joint Savings Account Solidity Smart Contract
This project is a Solidity smart contract that implements a joint savings account, which allows two Ethereum addresses to control a single account. The contract includes functionality for depositing and withdrawing funds, as well as tracking the last amount withdrawn and the balance of the contract.

## Getting Started
To use this smart contract, you will need access to a local blockchain development environment, such as the Remix IDE. Once you have the environment set up, you can deploy the JointSavings contract and interact with it through the Remix IDE interface.

## Prerequisites
To deploy and interact with the JointSavings contract, you will need:

* A local blockchain development environment, such as the Remix IDE.
* An Ethereum wallet with testnet Ether.

## Installing
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Open the Remix IDE and import the JointSavings.sol file.
* Compile the contract by clicking on the Solidity compiler in the left pane.
* In the Remix IDE, navigate to the “Deploy & Run Transactions” pane, and then make sure that “JavaScript VM” is selected as the environment.
* Click the Deploy button to deploy your smart contract, and then confirm that it successfully deployed.

## Usage
Once you have deployed the JointSavings contract, you can interact with it through the Remix IDE interface. To use the contract, follow these steps:

* Use the setAccounts function to define the authorized Ethereum addresses that will be able to withdraw funds from your contract.
* Use the deposit function to deposit funds into the contract.
* Use the withdraw function to withdraw funds from the contract.
